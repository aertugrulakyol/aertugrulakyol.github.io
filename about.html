          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I've spent my entire life looking for a way to express my
            creativity, and I've finally come to the conclusion that product
            design is the perfect fit for me. I wanted to learn programming
            before starting this journey, and during the pandemic, I attended
            Ankara University's department of internet and network technologies,
            where I graduated with highest grades. As a product designer now,
            this has actually given me skills that are extremely valuable, like
            programming language knowledge and improved engineering
            communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started working as a freelancer as soon as I received my college
            degree. The objective was to create the website for a business
            called Hidrojeo. However, after the project was complete, regardless
            of how happy the client was, I realized there was a lot I could do
            better, so I began my research. I then learned about the idea of
            user experience and signed up for the Google UX Design course. After
            taking this course and expanding my knowledge of user experience, I
            learned the principles of visual design and picked up skills in user
            interface, illustration, and photoshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to my interest and enthusiasm in video games, I looked for a
            freelance position to create game interfaces and collaborated with
            an independent game producer who created the title Balqabi.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Kiraz.co, I'm currently continuing my journey as a product
            designer in the areas of SaaS and e-commerce site design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm excited to use this rich and varied experience to collaborate
            with you on my current and upcoming projects!
