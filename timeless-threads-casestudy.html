          "As a takeaway from this project, I have learned how to use typography
          to create contrast between texts, smooth transition animations to make
          an object stand out, and how a minimal design approach can create a
          more sophisticated look. Next time, I should focus on breakpoints for
          a more tablet-friendly design as well. <br><br> &nbsp;<br> That's it for now. If you have
          any further suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach
          out to me. Thank you for your time, and have a great day!"
